# Multi-threaded Image Processing with OpenCV

This C++ application performs parallel image processing using OpenCV, implementing a custom convolution filter and histogram generation. The program is optimized for performance through multi-threading and includes thread-safe histogram computation.

## Features

- 5x5 Gaussian-like kernel convolution filter
- Thread-safe histogram generation
- Parallel image processing using multiple threads
- Histogram visualization output
- Memory-safe implementation
